# Take-Home Assignment
Part of Solutions Engineering at Celestia Labs involves on-boarding to new codebases and new tech stacks for our many different partnerships, and learning how to integrate them with Celestia. This asssignment is meant to test your ability to on-board to a new codebase, in a new language and tech stack. Here you'll find a server with a web API interface that allows a user to submit jobs, and check the status of those jobs.

This is a simplified, educational version of a real service we are currently developing, which computes zero-knowledge "commitment equivalence" proofs for usage in integrations with certain rollups (don't worry about all of those details).
